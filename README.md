## Presentation
    This is the repository developed for the 'HackTaFerme' hackathon in which we got the second place.
    This project was proposed by Sébastien and Basile at the vineyard level,
    and by Jean-Baptiste Guichon for the field crop plots.

    This project allows winemakers to detect the rate of healthy grapes in a bucket of grapes
    thanks to a picture.
    Field crop farmers may also receive information about parts of damaged plots.

1.  Windows
2.  Mac OS X
3.  Linux

## Technologies used
1.  Tensorflow - Artificial Intelligence
2.  Django Python
3.  Javascript
